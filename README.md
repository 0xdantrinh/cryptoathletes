# EAS 499 Senior Project: Cryptoathletes

Motivated by Cryptokitties’ successful application of the ERC-721 token standard, we sought out to create a similar Dapp game that focuses on professional athletes. Cryptoathletes are digital, collectible football athletes built on the Ethereum blockchain. They can be bought and created using ether, and can battle/faceoff against other users’ Cryptoathletes. Each athlete token possesses a set of offensive and defensive attributes that affects whether it will be victorious in a faceoff against another athlete token. Any new user of Cryptoathletes can create one free random athlete for his or herself after joining the game. Additional athletes are available for purchase through a pack system. Similar to popular App Store games, such as Hearthstone, users can purchase packs of these digitally collectible players (two athletes per pack) using ether. 

## Key Features 

### Create Random Athlete Token

In Cryptoathletes, first time users have the ability to generate their own ERC-721 athlete token. The user has the choice to name the token at the start of its creation. These athlete tokens are each given a randomly generated DNA attribute. (Randomness is a key issue facing many blockchain applications because of its difficulty to obtain, as I will later discuss.) This DNA attribute is just a uint (unsigned integer) that represents physical features of the players. I was not able to extend this feature to the front end of this iteration of my application, but I had planned to represent each pair of bytes within the uint as different physical features of the athletes (eye color, hair color, etc.) much like Cryptokitties. Each randomly generated athlete possesses the same default offensive and defensive ratings. For this iteration, the default offensive rating was set as 70 and default defensive rating as 50. Users will only be able to create a “free” random athlete token if they do not already own any athlete tokens. This limits new users from being able to create unlimited amount of athlete tokens. The following code is called by the JavaScript frontend to create the random athletes:
